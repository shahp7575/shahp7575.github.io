title: About Me

I am Parth and I am a graduate student in Data Science at Rutgers University. In the past I have worked as a Software Developer as well as a Support Engineer. I am passionate about data visualization, machine learning and digging the story behind the data. My long-term goal is to be the go-to person whenever data holds the key to solving a problem.

I enjoy working with Python, Tableau and Minitab.
Few of my projects include:

- Text mining project to classify disaster related tweets
- Classifying quality of red wines based on their physicochemical features
- An academic project to classify spam/non-spam emails.

Projects I am working on:

- Text summarizer that creates a game summary for every match in Spanish soccer league(La Liga)
- A data viz project visualizing all the game stats for FC Barcelona in La Liga.

When I am not working you will probably find me making music or watching soccer. I am; a forever student, an avid reader, a musicophile,  diehard FCB fan (*Visca Barca*), and a Netflix binger. I live in East Windsor, New Jersey with my purr-fect snuggle buddy. For more see:
